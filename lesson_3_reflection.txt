When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when add a feature or bug fix

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  because you don't want to be pulling commits that contains bugs or small minor change for the public to see

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork is cloning a remote repository onto your repository on github for tweaking changes.
  Cloning is making a copy from a github repository onto your local machine or making a copy of a repository on your local machine to another folder on your local machine.
  Branches is making another experimental or feature commit in the same repository in your local machine

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  can work offline - compare difference, view the log, make changes, merge before pushing it to Github
